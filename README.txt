Hey Marker

You can start the program by clicking the login.html file. 

In this README I will give instructions on how to navigate through our website without breaking things. 

To address off the start, we had to code all functionality a hour before the deadline due to Adobe XD complications that happened
due to a new update they had the night prior. We worked with what we got and this is the best we could do given we wanted to get
this in asap.

As a last update, our fake loading screens were giving us major issues when we attempted to add it in after the whole Adobe issue, 
if interested in seeing what it looked like the file Loading.html is in the code folder also. 

The website is fully functional when navigating from window to window, however some functionality is hard coded to 
simulate how we envisioned how the software will work. 

Starting from the login screen, you can simply press "guest" to go to the main screen. 

From here you can freely click on anything you would like, to see how things transition from screen to screen or how our popup 
windows function. 

To proceed to properly order, click the "input health" button. This will open the input health overlay. 

From here you can input anything to supliment actually inputting information. Once ready to move on you can clik the 
"generate suggestions" button located at the bottom. 

After loading is finished, the suggestions screen will popup. Click the first option (place 1).

From this screen, you can freely navigate using the arrow buttons, or by simply clicking on the icons on the left. 

To proceed to adding an item to cart, click the "Veg Chili" option on the top section (the green food icon). 
This will open up the item customization screen. From here, select Ingredient 4 then hit add to cart. 

NOTE: If a user tries to press the back button (on the site not the actual browser back) when items are in cart, a window warning 
the user will pop up. 

Once that is finished, you can proceed to checkout with the button on the right. 

For payment, simply click order. This will a confirmation window afterwards. 

On the confirmation window, click return home. This will bring you back to the home screen.

*AT THIS POINT WE ARE SIMULATING A USER COMING BACK TO THE SITE. If the direction isn't followed it will for sure not
work at intended* 

From there, click the history button in the top left. It will show that the history was updated (click the down arrow to see most
recent order). 

Click the order button that is next to your order (it will have the date Nov 27, 2020). This is simulating a user coming back on a later date who wants to order the same
order. 

This will prompt you to checkout, which essentially finishes all functionality for our interface. 

If you would like, you can click the user button in the top right of the program and hit the logout button.

And done! That is how our software would work.
